            passage: `The concept of sustainable development has evolved significantly since its introduction in the 1980s.

It encompasses not only the ability to use digital devices and software but also the critical thinking skills needed to evaluate online information. The proliferation of misinformation and fake news has made these evaluation skills increasingly important.

Educational institutions worldwide are grappling with how to integrate digital literacy into their curricula effectively. Some argue for dedicated courses, while others advocate for embedding these skills across all subjects.`,

            passage: "Passage 1: The Digital Double-Edged Sword: Social Media and Youth Mental Health in South Africa  <br><br> 1. In an era defined by digital interconnectedness, social media platforms have become deeply embedded in the lives of South African youth. For a generation that has grown up with smartphones as extensions of their being, platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) are not merely tools for communication but primary arenas for socialisation, identity formation, and self-expression. While these platforms offer unprecedented opportunities for connection and community, a growing body of research points to a troubling correlation: the rise of their pervasive use coincides with an alarming increase in mental health challenges among adolescents and young adults, including anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem.1 <br><br> 2. At the heart of this complex issue lies the curated nature of online life. Social media feeds are often highlight reels, showcasing idealised lifestyles, flawless appearances, and perpetual success. For a young person navigating the already tumultuous period of identity development, this constant exposure to unrealistic standards can fuel a damaging cycle of social comparison. This phenomenon is not benign; it can lead to profound feelings of inadequacy and worthlessness.2 The psychological pressure is compounded by what researchers term \"Fear of Missing Out\" or FoMO. Seeing peers at social gatherings one was not invited to, or on holidays one cannot afford, can trigger intense anxiety and a feeling of social isolation, paradoxically on platforms designed to connect us.3 <br><br> 3. The very architecture of these platforms is engineered to be compelling, operating on algorithms that prioritise captivating content to encourage endless scrolling. This design can foster an unhealthy dependency, where the dopamine rush from 'likes' and notifications becomes a sought-after reward.1 This dynamic is a key concern of displacement theory, which posits that excessive time spent on social media displaces other activities crucial for healthy mental development. Hours spent scrolling are hours not spent on restorative sleep, physical activity, face-to-face interaction, or engaging in hobbies that build genuine self-worth.2 Studies in South Africa have linked this displacement to poor sleep quality, which in turn heightens stress and diminishes cognitive function, directly impacting academic performance and emotional regulation.4 <br><br> 4. Furthermore, the digital world is not always a safe space. Cyberbullying has emerged as a particularly insidious threat, as online harassment can follow a young person into the sanctity of their home, making it feel inescapable. The anonymity afforded by some platforms can embolden aggressors, and the permanence of digital content means that hurtful comments or images can have a long-lasting psychological toll.1 For young women in particular, unsolicited comments and body shaming are frequent occurrences, contributing significantly to anxiety and body image issues.5 <br><br> 5. Addressing this challenge requires a multi-pronged approach that moves beyond simply blaming technology. It necessitates fostering digital literacy among young people, teaching them to critically evaluate the curated nature of online content and understand its potential impact on their psyche. Open communication within families and schools about online experiences is vital, creating safe environments for young people to discuss issues like peer pressure and cyberbullying without fear of judgment. Ultimately, the goal is not to demonise social media, but to equip the youth with the resilience and critical awareness needed to navigate its complexities, harnessing its benefits while mitigating its risks for a healthier, more balanced digital life.",
